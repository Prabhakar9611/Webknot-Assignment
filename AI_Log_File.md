I need to build a campus event reporting prototype quickly. I want clean APIs and sqlLite in easy and simple way
ChatGPT said:

Got it ✅ You want a quick prototype for a Campus Event Reporting System with:

Clean REST APIs

SQLite database (lightweight, easy to set up)

Simple, maintainable structure

Here’s a straightforward plan:

1. Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (lightweight, clean for APIs)

Database: SQLite (file-based, no setup hassle)

ORM: SQLAlchemy (makes schema and queries cleaner)

2. Basic Features

For a prototype, we can start with:

Events → Title, Description, Date, Location, Created By

Reports → Linked to an Event, Type (issue/feedback), Reporter info, Timestamp

3. Project Structure
campus_events/
│── app.py               # Flask entry
│── models.py            # Database models
│── routes/
│    ├── events.py       # Event APIs
│    └── reports.py      # Report APIs
│── database.db          # SQLite DB
│── requirements.txt

4. Example Code

app.py

from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///database.db"
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS"] = False

db = SQLAlchemy(app)

from models import Event, Report
from routes.events import event_bp
from routes.reports import report_bp

# Register Blueprints
app.register_blueprint(event_bp, url_prefix="/events")
app.register_blueprint(report_bp, url_prefix="/reports")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()  # Create tables if not exist
    app.run(debug=True)


models.py

from app import db

class Event(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    date = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    location = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    created_by = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)

class Report(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    event_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("event.id"), nullable=False)
    type = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)   # issue/feedback
    reporter = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    timestamp = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)


routes/events.py

from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from app import db
from models import Event

event_bp = Blueprint("events", __name__)

@event_bp.route("/", methods=["POST"])
def create_event():
    data = request.json
    new_event = Event(**data)
    db.session.add(new_event)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Event created successfully!"}), 201

@event_bp.route("/", methods=["GET"])
def get_events():
    events = Event.query.all()
    return jsonify([{
        "id": e.id, "title": e.title, "description": e.description,
        "date": e.date, "location": e.location, "created_by": e.created_by
    } for e in events])


routes/reports.py

from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from app import db
from models import Report

report_bp = Blueprint("reports", __name__)

@report_bp.route("/", methods=["POST"])
def create_report():
    data = request.json
    new_report = Report(**data)
    db.session.add(new_report)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Report submitted successfully!"}), 201

@report_bp.route("/", methods=["GET"])
def get_reports():
    reports = Report.query.all()
    return jsonify([{
        "id": r.id, "event_id": r.event_id, "type": r.type,
        "reporter": r.reporter, "timestamp": r.timestamp
    } for r in reports])

5. Example API Calls

Create Event

POST /events/
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "title": "Tech Fest",
  "description": "Annual technology festival",
  "date": "2025-09-15",
  "location": "Main Auditorium",
  "created_by": "Admin"
}


Get All Events → GET /events/

Create Report → POST /reports/

Get All Reports → GET /reports/

👉 This gives you a ready-to-run prototype with SQLite and clean APIs.
Would you like me to also add a frontend (Next.js or simple HTML/JS) to quickly test these APIs, or keep it backend-only for now?

You said:
Should event IDs be global or scoped per college?
ChatGPT said:

Good question 👍 — this depends on how you’re scoping your Campus Event Reporting System. Let’s break it down:

🔹 Option 1: Global Event IDs (Default Auto-increment)

How it works: Each event just gets a single unique ID across the whole system (1, 2, 3…).

When to use:

If the system is meant to be centralized (one database, all colleges share it).

Easier to implement, fewer complications.

Pros:

Simple, no need for composite keys.

Easy for cross-college queries (admin can see all events).

Cons:

IDs won’t “reset” per college (College A event could be ID=1, College B first event could be ID=57).

🔹 Option 2: Scoped Event IDs (Per College)

How it works: Each college has its own sequence of event IDs (1, 2, 3… per college).

Implementation:

Add a college_id field in your Event table.

Primary key could be a composite key (college_id, event_id) or just use a UUID/separate counter per college.

When to use:

If colleges are managed as independent tenants (multi-tenant architecture).

When you want “Event #1” to make sense inside each college.

Pros:

College admins see neat numbering (Event 1 always exists in their scope).

Good if you might later split colleges into separate databases.

Cons:

More complex queries, especially if you ever need cross-college aggregation.

🔹 Recommendation

For a prototype → use global event IDs (simple, less overhead).

If you plan for multi-college scalability (like a SaaS for multiple campuses) → use scoped IDs with college_id column.

👉 I can show you a modified schema with college_id included if you want to future-proof it.
Do you want me to update the code to support multi-college (scoped event IDs) or keep it single-college (global IDs) for now?

You said:
Reports I need: event popularity, student participation, event stats (attendance %, avg rating)
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 You’re asking for analytics reports on events, so let’s extend our Campus Event Reporting System design.

Currently, we have Event and Report. To get popularity, participation, and stats, we’ll need two new tables:

🔹 Updated Database Schema
1. Event

Already exists:

id, title, description, date, location, created_by

2. Participation

Tracks which student attended which event (for attendance %).

class Participation(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    event_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("event.id"), nullable=False)
    student_id = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    attended = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)  # mark attendance

3. EventRating

Captures feedback rating (1–5 scale).

class EventRating(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    event_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("event.id"), nullable=False)
    student_id = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    rating = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)  # 1-5

🔹 Reports You Asked For
1. Event Popularity

👉 Based on number of participants registered/attended.
SQLAlchemy query:

from sqlalchemy import func

def event_popularity():
    result = db.session.query(
        Participation.event_id,
        func.count(Participation.id).label("attendees")
    ).group_by(Participation.event_id).all()
    return [{"event_id": e[0], "attendees": e[1]} for e in result]

2. Student Participation

👉 Show which students attended events.

def student_participation(student_id):
    result = Participation.query.filter_by(student_id=student_id).all()
    return [{
        "event_id": p.event_id,
        "attended": p.attended
    } for p in result]

3. Event Stats (Attendance %, Avg Rating)

👉 Attendance % = (attended students ÷ total registered) × 100
👉 Avg Rating = mean of all ratings

def event_stats(event_id):
    total = Participation.query.filter_by(event_id=event_id).count()
    attended = Participation.query.filter_by(event_id=event_id, attended=True).count()
    avg_rating = db.session.query(func.avg(EventRating.rating)).filter_by(event_id=event_id).scalar()
    
    return {
        "event_id": event_id,
        "attendance_percentage": (attended / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0,
        "average_rating": round(avg_rating, 2) if avg_rating else None
    }

🔹 Example API Endpoints

GET /reports/popularity → list events sorted by popularity

GET /reports/student/<student_id> → events attended by a student

GET /reports/event/<event_id>/stats → attendance % + avg rating

✅ With this, your system now supports:

Event Popularity (attendance counts)

Student Participation (tracking per student)

Event Stats (attendance %, avg rating)

Do you want me to add these APIs into the earlier Flask code (like reports.py but for analytics), or just keep the queries for now?

You said:
I’ll add filter by event_type and college_id.
ChatGPT said:

That’s a smart move ✅ — adding event_type and college_id will make your system much more powerful for filtering and reporting.

Here’s how we can update things:

🔹 Database Updates
Event Model
class Event(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    date = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    location = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    created_by = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)

    # New fields
    event_type = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)   # e.g., "sports", "cultural", "tech"
    college_id = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)   # e.g., "C001"

🔹 Filtering in Reports
1. Event Popularity with Filters
def event_popularity(event_type=None, college_id=None):
    query = db.session.query(
        Participation.event_id,
        func.count(Participation.id).label("attendees")
    ).join(Event, Event.id == Participation.event_id)

    if event_type:
        query = query.filter(Event.event_type == event_type)
    if college_id:
        query = query.filter(Event.college_id == college_id)

    result = query.group_by(Participation.event_id).all()
    return [{"event_id": e[0], "attendees": e[1]} for e in result]

2. Event Stats with Filters
def event_stats(event_id, college_id=None):
    query_total = Participation.query.filter_by(event_id=event_id)
    query_attended = Participation.query.filter_by(event_id=event_id, attended=True)

    if college_id:
        query_total = query_total.join(Event).filter(Event.college_id == college_id)
        query_attended = query_attended.join(Event).filter(Event.college_id == college_id)

    total = query_total.count()
    attended = query_attended.count()
    avg_rating = db.session.query(func.avg(EventRating.rating)).filter_by(event_id=event_id).scalar()

    return {
        "event_id": event_id,
        "attendance_percentage": (attended / total * 100) if total > 0 else 0,
        "average_rating": round(avg_rating, 2) if avg_rating else None
    }

3. API Example (Flask Route)
@report_bp.route("/popularity", methods=["GET"])
def get_event_popularity():
    event_type = request.args.get("event_type")
    college_id = request.args.get("college_id")
    data = event_popularity(event_type, college_id)
    return jsonify(data)


👉 Usage:

/reports/popularity?event_type=tech

/reports/popularity?college_id=C002

/reports/popularity?event_type=sports&college_id=C003

✅ Result

Now you’ll have flexible reporting:

Popularity by event type (sports vs cultural vs tech).

Stats per college (for admin dashboards).

Combined filters (tech events in College A).

Do you want me to fully integrate these filtered report APIs into your earlier Flask code, so you’ll have one clean backend ready to run?

You said:
Should I store EventType as enum?
ChatGPT said:

Great question 👌 — whether to store event_type as an enum depends on your use case and how flexible you want the system to be. Let’s break it down:

🔹 Option 1: Plain String (Current Way)
event_type = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)


✅ Easy to add new types (just insert a new event with "hackathon", "seminar", etc.)

✅ No schema changes needed if requirements grow

❌ No strict validation — someone could insert "hackthn" by mistake

👉 Best for prototypes or when types may evolve often.

🔹 Option 2: Python Enum + SQLAlchemy Enum
import enum
from sqlalchemy import Enum

class EventType(enum.Enum):
    SPORTS = "sports"
    CULTURAL = "cultural"
    TECH = "tech"
    SEMINAR = "seminar"

event_type = db.Column(Enum(EventType), nullable=False)


✅ Safer (enforces allowed values only)

✅ Self-documenting (developers clearly see valid types)

❌ Adding a new type requires code change + migration

👉 Best when your categories are fixed and stable (e.g., only Sports, Cultural, Tech).

🔹 Option 3: Separate EventType Table (FK)
class EventType(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), unique=True, nullable=False)

class Event(db.Model):
    ...
    event_type_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("event_type.id"), nullable=False)


✅ Flexible (you can insert new types at runtime, no code change)

✅ Easy to manage from an admin dashboard

❌ Slightly more complex (join needed in queries)

👉 Best for multi-college systems where admins might define their own categories.

🔹 My Recommendation

For your prototype → use Enum if the set of types is small and won’t change much.

If you expect colleges to add their own event types → use a separate EventType table.

If speed is the priority and types are uncertain → stick with string for now.

⚡ Question for you:
Do you see event_type being fixed categories across all colleges, or should colleges be able to define custom types (like “Alumni Meetup”, “Hackathon”, etc.)?

You said:
Decision: Followed
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — since you said “Decision: Followed”, I’ll assume you’ve made your choice between String / Enum / Separate Table for event_type and applied it in your schema.

✅ Next Steps (depending on what you chose):

If String → keep things simple, just add event_type as a String(50) column.

If Enum → define a Python enum and bind it with SQLAlchemy Enum.

If Separate Table → add an EventType model and link with a foreign key.

⚡ Now that event_type and college_id are in place, your reports layer (popularity, participation, stats) can filter cleanly by both.

👉 Do you want me to integrate the final APIs (with filtering + stats) into a single ready-to-run Flask backend, so you can test it right away?

You said:
For feedback rating constraints?
ChatGPT said:

Great that you’re thinking about constraints 👌 — feedback ratings should always be controlled, otherwise you’ll end up with invalid values (like -3, 10, "five", etc.).

Here’s how you can handle it in your system:

🔹 At the Database Level (SQLAlchemy + SQLite)
class EventRating(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    event_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("event.id"), nullable=False)
    student_id = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    rating = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)

    __table_args__ = (
        db.CheckConstraint("rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5", name="check_rating_range"),
    )


✅ Enforces valid ratings (1–5) directly in the database

❌ If someone tries to insert invalid data, DB will reject it with an error

🔹 At the API (Validation Layer)

In your routes/reports.py or a new routes/ratings.py:

@report_bp.route("/rate", methods=["POST"])
def rate_event():
    data = request.json
    rating = data.get("rating")

    if not (1 <= rating <= 5):
        return jsonify({"error": "Rating must be between 1 and 5"}), 400

    new_rating = EventRating(**data)
    db.session.add(new_rating)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Rating submitted successfully"}), 201


✅ Gives user-friendly error message instead of raw DB error

✅ Extra safety before hitting DB

🔹 Extra Considerations

Unique Constraint:
Each student should only rate an event once.

__table_args__ = (
    db.UniqueConstraint("event_id", "student_id", name="unique_event_student_rating"),
)


→ Prevents duplicate ratings by the same student.

Nullable:
Keep rating non-nullable (as above).

Future-proofing:
If you want textual feedback too, add a comment = db.Column(db.Text) field.

✅ With this, your ratings will always be valid, unique per student per event, and extendable with comments if needed.

Do you also want me to add a report API that returns the distribution of ratings per event (e.g., how many 5-star, 4-star, etc.), for better event analytics?

You said:
Decision: Followed
ChatGPT said:

Nice 🚀 — since you’ve marked it “Decision: Followed”, I’ll assume you’ve already applied the rating constraints (range check + unique student-event rule) in your schema and API.

That means your EventRating table is now:

✅ rating constrained between 1–5

✅ student_id + event_id unique (no duplicate ratings)

✅ Clean validation at both DB and API layer

⚡ Next logical step:
Now that you have attendance, ratings, and filters (college + type), you can build analytics APIs like:

Rating distribution per event (1★–5★ counts)

Top-rated events (avg rating + attendance %)

College-wise event performance

👉 Do you want me to add these analytics APIs into your Flask code so you’ll have a ready-made reporting dashboard backend?

You said:
How to avoid double attendance?
ChatGPT said:

Good call 👍 — double attendance (a student being marked twice for the same event) is a common issue in event systems.

Here are the best ways to avoid it:

🔹 1. Database Constraint (Strongest Protection)

In your Participation model:

class Participation(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    event_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("event.id"), nullable=False)
    student_id = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    attended = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)

    __table_args__ = (
        db.UniqueConstraint("event_id", "student_id", name="unique_event_student"),
    )


✅ Guarantees that a student can appear only once per event
❌ If someone tries to insert again, DB raises an error

🔹 2. API Check (User-Friendly Layer)

Before inserting into Participation, check if that record already exists:

@event_bp.route("/attend", methods=["POST"])
def mark_attendance():
    data = request.json
    event_id = data.get("event_id")
    student_id = data.get("student_id")

    existing = Participation.query.filter_by(event_id=event_id, student_id=student_id).first()
    if existing:
        return jsonify({"error": "Attendance already recorded"}), 400

    new_entry = Participation(event_id=event_id, student_id=student_id, attended=True)
    db.session.add(new_entry)
    db.session.commit()

    return jsonify({"message": "Attendance marked successfully"}), 201


✅ Prevents duplicate records gracefully
✅ Returns a friendly error instead of a raw DB error

🔹 3. Design Considerations

QR Code / Unique Token → Students scan a unique code (mapped to their student_id) once per event.

Check-in Window → Prevents re-checking within X minutes.

Audit Logging → Keep a log of attempts to mark attendance again (useful for fraud detection).

✅ Recommendation

Use both:

A unique constraint at the DB level (hard protection)

An API check (better error handling)

That way, you get robustness + good UX.

Do you also want me to extend this so that you can track check-in and check-out times (not just attended = True/False), so you could later calculate duration of participation?

You said:
Partially followed. I’ll return "Already marked"
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👌 — returning "Already marked" is a good UX choice. That means you’ve partially followed my recommendation by handling it gracefully at the API layer instead of relying only on DB errors.

Your attendance API flow now looks like:

@event_bp.route("/attend", methods=["POST"])
def mark_attendance():
    data = request.json
    event_id = data.get("event_id")
    student_id = data.get("student_id")

    existing = Participation.query.filter_by(event_id=event_id, student_id=student_id).first()
    if existing:
        return jsonify({"message": "Already marked"}), 200   # <-- User-friendly

    new_entry = Participation(event_id=event_id, student_id=student_id, attended=True)
    db.session.add(new_entry)
    db.session.commit()

    return jsonify({"message": "Attendance marked successfully"}), 201


✅ This way:

First attempt → "Attendance marked successfully"

Second attempt → "Already marked"

⚡ Extra suggestion (optional):
You might still keep the DB unique constraint as a safety net, even if you don’t depend on it for messaging.
That way, if two requests hit at the same millisecond (rare but possible in concurrent systems), the DB will still prevent duplicates.

Do you want me to also help design a check-in / check-out attendance model (instead of just a boolean attended) so you can track how long each student actually stayed at the event?

You said:
Cancelled events?
ChatGPT said:

Good question 👍 — you definitely need a way to handle cancelled events, otherwise your reports (attendance, ratings, popularity) will look misleading.

Here’s how you can manage cancellations:

🔹 1. Add a status field to Event
class Event(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    date = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
    location = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    created_by = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)

    event_type = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    college_id = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)

    # NEW
    status = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default="scheduled")
    # values → "scheduled", "ongoing", "completed", "cancelled"

🔹 2. API for Cancelling
@event_bp.route("/<int:event_id>/cancel", methods=["PUT"])
def cancel_event(event_id):
    event = Event.query.get(event_id)
    if not event:
        return jsonify({"error": "Event not found"}), 404
    
    if event.status == "cancelled":
        return jsonify({"message": "Event already cancelled"}), 200
    
    event.status = "cancelled"
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify({"message": "Event cancelled successfully"}), 200

🔹 3. Reports Impact

Popularity / Attendance Stats → should exclude cancelled events.
Example:

query = db.session.query(Event).filter(Event.status != "cancelled")


Participation → students shouldn’t be allowed to mark attendance for cancelled events.

if event.status == "cancelled":
    return jsonify({"error": "Cannot mark attendance for a cancelled event"}), 400


Ratings → block ratings for cancelled events (or ignore them in stats).

🔹 4. Optional Enhancements

Soft delete → Instead of deleting events, just set status="cancelled".

Cancellation Reason → add a cancellation_reason column (optional).

Notifications → send a message to all registered students (future feature).

✅ This way:

You preserve event history.

Cancelled events don’t affect analytics.

Students/admins get consistent messaging.

Do you also want me to add a filter so /events/ only returns non-cancelled events by default, while admins can still fetch all (including cancelled)?

You said:
Decision: Deviated (out of scope)
ChatGPT said:

Understood 👍 — since you marked it “Decision: Deviated (out of scope)”, you’ve decided not to implement cancelled events handling right now.

That’s perfectly fine for a prototype 🚀 — it keeps things simple.
Currently your system will just treat all created events as active, and you’ll avoid the extra complexity of:

Event status field

Special rules for attendance/ratings

Filtering logic in reports

👉 Later, if cancellation becomes important (e.g., for production rollout), you can easily extend the Event model with a status column and update the APIs.

Would you like me to help you summarize the current scope of your prototype (what’s in vs. what’s out), so you’ll have a clean boundary before adding more features?

You said:
Anything else?
ChatGPT said:

Yes 👍 — since you’ve already covered the core essentials (Events, Participation, Ratings, Reports, Filters, No double attendance, Valid constraints), here are a few optional but useful additions you might consider depending on scope:

🔹 Small, Low-Effort Improvements

Timestamps

Add created_at and updated_at to Event, Participation, EventRating.

Helps with audit logs and trend reporting.

created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=db.func.now())
updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=db.func.now(), onupdate=db.func.now())


Student Table (Optional)

Right now you just use student_id (string).

Later, you might want a Student table with name, email, college_id → cleaner relationships.

Rating + Comment Together

You already constrained ratings (1–5).

Add a comment field for qualitative feedback.

🔹 Reporting Enhancements

Rating Distribution Report

Instead of just avg rating, return counts of ⭐1–5 per event.

Example API response:

{
  "event_id": 12,
  "average_rating": 4.2,
  "distribution": { "5": 30, "4": 12, "3": 5, "2": 1, "1": 0 }
}


Top N Events

Endpoint to return most popular (by attendance) or highest rated events.

Useful for dashboards.

🔹 Scalability / Cleanliness

Pagination for Events & Reports

Use query params like ?page=1&limit=10.

Avoids huge API payloads.

Validation Schemas (Marshmallow or Pydantic)

Cleaner request validation (instead of if not field).

✅ If you’re aiming for a prototype with analytics, I’d say the only thing still worth adding is rating distribution per event (gives admins richer insight with minimal effort).

Would you like me to sketch out a final clean API list (all endpoints grouped: events, participation, ratings, reports) so you have a clear blueprint of what’s in your prototype?

2. Introduction

Campus events such as workshops, seminars, cultural fests, and sports activities are central to student engagement. However, most institutions face challenges in tracking participation, collecting feedback, and generating meaningful insights from these events.

This project addresses these challenges by providing a lightweight prototype for event reporting using Flask (Python) and SQLite. The system offers clean APIs for managing events, recording attendance, collecting feedback, and generating analytical reports.

3. Objectives

To develop a simple, API-based event reporting system for campuses.

To enable event creation and filtering by type and college.

To ensure accurate attendance tracking with prevention of duplicate entries.

To collect student feedback ratings (1–5) for quality evaluation.

To generate reports on event popularity, participation, and feedback analytics.

4. System Design
4.1 Architecture Overview

The system follows a 3-layer architecture:

Frontend/API Clients (e.g., Postman, Web UI in future)
→ Makes requests to backend APIs.

Flask Backend (Business Logic Layer)
→ Provides REST APIs for events, participation, ratings, and reports.

SQLite Database (Data Layer)
→ Stores events, attendance, and feedback.

4.2 Database Schema

Tables:

Event

id (PK)

name

event_type (enum: seminar, workshop, cultural, sports, etc.)

college_id

date

created_at, updated_at

Participation

id (PK)

event_id (FK → Event.id)

student_id

timestamp

(Unique constraint on event_id + student_id to prevent double attendance)

EventRating

id (PK)

event_id (FK → Event.id)

student_id

rating (1–5, with validation)

comment (optional)

(Unique constraint on event_id + student_id)

4.3 Data Flow

Student → Marks attendance → Stored in Participation table.

Student → Submits rating → Stored in EventRating table.

Admin → Queries Reports → Data aggregated from Events, Participation, Ratings.

5. Features Implemented

Event Management: create, list, filter by type and college.

Participation: attendance marking with duplicate prevention.

Feedback: 1–5 rating with optional comments, one rating per student per event.

Reports:

Event Popularity → total participants per event.

Student Participation → list of attended events.

Event Statistics → attendance %, avg rating, distribution of ratings.

6. Limitations

Cancelled events handling is not implemented.

No student/college master table (currently only IDs used).

No advanced authentication (prototype assumes trusted access).

7. Future Enhancements

Cancelled Event Support – allow admins to cancel events with reason.

Master Tables – for students and colleges with richer details.

Notifications – email/SMS reminders for upcoming events.

Dashboards – graphical visualizations of reports for admins.

8. Conclusion

The Campus Event Reporting Prototype provides a minimal but complete solution for event management, participation tracking, and analytics. With clean APIs and a lightweight SQLite backend, it is easy to deploy and extend.

This system demonstrates how institutions can move from manual reporting to a data-driven approach, paving the way for better planning, engagement, and continuous improvement of campus activities.

✅ Done!
This is a ready design doc draft. You just need to:

Add a cover/title page,

Insert 1–2 diagrams (Architecture + ER diagram),

Export to PDF.

👉 Next step: Do you want me to also generate the prototype code skeleton + README (with the folder structure and example endpoints) so your submission package is complete?

You said:
Thanks
ChatGPT said:

You’re welcome 🙌 glad I could help.

You now have:

✅ A clean design document draft

✅ A submission checklist

If you need, I can still prepare the prototype code + README skeleton so you’ll have a plug-and-play project folder for submission.

👉 Do you want me to generate that code for you as well?
